                    <div class="aboutme-content-text">
                        <p>I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, majoring in Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Studies (IDST) with a concentration in Biomechanics of Society, graduating in May 2027. I am a Mathematics major because numbers do not lie, and this sense of security within mathematics has always drawn me to it. To apply my foundational understanding of mathematics, my IDST will focus on the intersection of infectious diseases and biomechanics. However, the translation of science into society is not always logical. Therefore, my IDST will also include studying the effective implementation of public health interventions focused on utilizing sports as a social institution. These majors will give me the foundational understanding to become an infectious disease rheumatologist. </p>
                        <p>My interest in health equity started in high school, after reading the book <i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> by Tracy Kidder. The interplay of politics, business, culture, and medicine in providing healing for infectious diseases fascinated me. Curious to know more, I spoke to professors, such as Dr. Tracy Nelson, where I learned about implementing solutions within the social determinants of health while preserving cultural identities through community-based participatory research and social prescribing. Consequently, to make an impact in these areas, I joined Dr. Rushika Perera’s laboratory in the Center for Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, researching the role of triglycerides in the Dengue life cycle.</p>
                        <p>While my passion for health equity started in high school, biomechanics has always been an interest of mine since I grew up as an athlete. Since Gordon Hayward’s injury in 2017, I hated to see the ability to move taken away from others because I knew how much joy it provided me. As I continued to learn about injuries and their biomechanics, I realized the prevalence of ACL injuries in women, as the dreams of my teammates and the careers of my role models were derailed. Thus, I read about ACL injuries in women, all of which argued that women were at a higher risk, yet there were still no preventative solutions. This intersection of health equity and biomechanics furthered my interest in movement science by putting it through a sociological framework. Thus, I am a prospective research assistant in Dr. Troy Blackburn’s Lab to research the effect, if any, that vibrational therapy on the quadriceps muscle has on the development of knee osteoarthritis in women. My passion for infectious diseases and movement science has motivated me to become a physician specializing in infectious disease rheumatology. </p>
                        <p class="last-p">In addition to my Mathematics and IDST majors, to pursue this career, in the summer of 2025, I will be participating in the National Outdoor Leadership School’s Accelerated Wilderness EMT program at the Wyss Wilderness Medicine Campus. As an infectious disease rheumatologist, I will be providing healing in areas that do not have all the ideal treatments available. The NOLS program will improve my skills to become a resourceful physician through the intentional experience of “unideal” circumstances. Through these experiences, I will have a foundation to provide healing to patients abroad in underserved areas. </p>
