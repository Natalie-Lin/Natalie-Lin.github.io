            <h1 class="page-header">About Me</h1>
            <div class="aboutme-content">
                <p>I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill–originally from Fort Collins, Colorado–majoring 
                    in math and interdisciplinary studies with a concentration in biomechanics of society, graduating in May 2027. I 
                    am a math major because I have always enjoyed the security within math, since numbers do not lie. Furthermore, I 
                    am an interdisciplinary studies major, so I can study the utilization of sports as a social institution from a 
                    health point of view, in addition to the science behind infectious diseases and biomechanics. Thus, I will focus on 
                    health equity and movement science, while having the foundational understanding of math. These majors will give me 
                    the foundational understanding to become a pediatric infectious disease rheumatologist.</p>
                <p>I first became interested in movement science as a sports fanatic. The first injury I remember was Gordon Hayward 
                    fracturing his tibia in the 2017 Celtics vs the Cavaliers season opener. I found it interesting how little differences 
                    in common movements led to injuries. As I continued to learn about biomechanics of injury, the issue of ACL injuries, 
                    particularly in women, became apparent to me, as many of my teammates went down and role models had their careers 
                    derailed. So, I read more literature on ACL injuries in women, all of which argued that women were at a higher risk, 
                    but there were still no solutions toward mitigating this problem. This intersection of health equity and biomechanics 
                    furthered my interest in movement science through a sociological framework.</p>
                <p>My interest in health equity started in high school, after reading the book <i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> by Tracy 
                    Kidder, which exposed me to the systemic inequities in medicine. As someone who had always been interested in other 
                    cultures, these issues stuck with me, and I aim to heal byhealbecame passionate about providing healing by attacking 
                    the social determinants of health while preserving cultural identities. To make an impact in these areas, I joined 
                    Dr. Rushika Perera’s laboratory in the Center for Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, researching the role of 
                    triglycerides in the Dengue life cycle. Additionally, I co-founded free tutoring programs since education is one of 
                    the social determinants of health. Infectious diseases are impacted by the social determinants of health and rooted 
                    in health equity, and many infectious diseases impact movement, which has been a source of opportunity for me and 
                    others. These factors have motivated me to become a physician specializing in pediatric infectious disease 
                    rheumatology. </p>
                <p class="last-p">In the summer of 2025, I will be participating in the National Outdoor Leadership School’s Accelerated Wilderness 
                    EMT program at the Wyss Wilderness Medicine Campus in Lander, Wyoming. In the future, I hope to provide healing in 
                    areas that do not have all the ideal treatments available. The NOLS wprogram will improve my skills to become a 
                    resourceful doctor through the intentional experience of “unideal” circumstances. Through these experiences, I will 
                    have a foundation to provide healing to patients abroad in underserved areas.</p>
