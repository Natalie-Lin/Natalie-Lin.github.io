					<p>The first sports injury I remember being fascinated by was Gordon Hayward’s injury in the 2017 season opener against the Cavaliers. I was watching for LeBron James, but when Gordon Hayward had his leg bent in ways it definitely should not have been, I was fascinated. So, I started diving into sports injuries. As an athlete, the sports injuries scared me as I did not realize these were even possibilities that could happen in the sports that I played every day, but as someone who was curious, I could not stop learning about all the mechanisms and possibilities. Then, in high school, I read the book Mountains Beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder, which follows the journey of Dr. Paul Farmer. As someone who had always been interested in other cultures, this book fascinated me as I got a glimpse into how medicine looks in other cultures. This book exposed me to the inequities that exist within medicine because of systemic/institutionalized problems. These issues stuck with me, and I became passionate about breaking down these barriers by attacking the social determinants of health while preserving cultural identities to improve health outcomes as a physician. So, I combined these two passions into rheumatology regarding infectious diseases. At the root of the problem, infectious diseases are impacted by the social determinants of health and rooted in health equity, followed by the impact of movement, which has been a source of opportunity for me and others.</p>
					<p>I am currently a first-year student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, originally from Fort Collins, Colorado. I am majoring in math and biomechanics of society as a part of the class of 2027. I have always enjoyed the permanence and security within math and want to dive deeper into the subject to use these skills toward medicine. Additionally, I am a biomechanics of society IDST major, so I can study the importance of sports as a social institution as well as how it interacts with healthcare and movement science. Thus, I will get to focus on health equity and my passion for movement and sports. Specifically, I will focus on women and children (girls) in sports. </p>
					<p>In the summer of 2025, I will be participating in the National Outdoor Leadership School’s Accelerated Wilderness EMT program at the Wyss Wilderness Medicine Campus in Lander, Wyoming. In the future, I hope to work in places and situations that may not have everything needed for treatment, but still want to provide healing. This program will increase my skills to become a resourceful doctor. This will give me the opportunity to have the experience in these situations, so I can provide healing to patients abroad in underserved areas. Additionally, the focus on clinical practice in which real, non-textbook, experiential learning is of high value to me since no patients will ever look exactly like the textbook, so this program will give me the most experience to apply my knowledge and gain the skills to provide healing in real-life situations. </p>
					<p>Combining my passions for health equity, infectious diseases, and movement science, these steps will provide me with a basis to become a physician specializing in rheumatology of infectious diseases that affect skeletal movement.</p>
